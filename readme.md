This project aims to create a completely FOSS-based ECU, from software to hardware and documentation.
The control software will be created using a model based design approach, using Scilab/Xcos. After the Xcos-model is finished, the tool X2C is used to create C-code based on the model.

Currently used versions:
Scilab 6.1.1 --> https://www.scilab.org/download/scilab-6.1.1
X2C    6.5.3189 --> https://x2c.lcm.at/downloads/
